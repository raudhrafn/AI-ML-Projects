# AI-ML-Projects

Welcome to my **AI-ML-Projects** repository!

This space will showcase my journey applying data analysis and machine learning techniques to interesting datasets. While my long-term goal is to build a diverse collection of AI projects, I'm starting with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to uncover meaningful patterns and insights.

The initial projects will focus on thorough data exploration before gradually expanding into predictive modeling, classification problems, and more advanced machine learning applications. Each project will include detailed documentation of my process, findings, and code implementation.

I'm building this portfolio to demonstrate my analytical approach and growing technical skills while tackling real-world problems with data. Check back soon as I add more projects and expand into different areas of machine learning!

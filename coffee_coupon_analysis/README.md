# Coffee Coupon Analysis

This project analyzes factors influencing the acceptance of coffee shop coupons using the `coupons.csv` dataset, which contains survey responses about coupon usage behavior in various contexts.

The analysis was conducted in the Jupyter Notebook 'coffee_coupon_analysis.ipynb' and consists of:
* Data munging and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations include bar plots showing differences in acceptance proportion for target conditions.

## Findings

The analysis reveals several factors significantly influencing coffee shop coupon acceptance:

* **Visit Frequency**: Regular coffee shop patrons (>3 visits per month) show substantially higher acceptance rates
* **Temporal Patterns**: Morning coupon distributions yield significantly higher acceptance rates
* **Demographic Insights**:
  * Students and healthcare professionals consistently demonstrate higher acceptance rates
  * Adults accompanied by friends accept at higher rates than solo drivers

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, coffee shop coupon campaigns should:
1. Prioritize morning distribution windows
2. Target frequent coffee shop visitors
3. Focus on student and healthcare professional segments

## Future Work

Potential extensions of this analysis include:
* Developing predictive models to identify high-potential acceptors
* A/B testing different coupon values and expiration times
* Comparing coffee shop acceptance patterns with other coupon types
